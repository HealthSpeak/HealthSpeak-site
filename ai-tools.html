        <h2>How Our AI Tools Work</h2>
        <p>
          HealthSpeak integrates optional artificial intelligence tools to
          assist you before, during and after your appointments.  These
          features are meant to enhance your understanding and support
          self‑advocacy.  They do not provide medical advice and should
          be used in consultation with your healthcare provider.

            <h3>Explain Symptoms</h3>
            <p>
              Struggling to describe what you’re experiencing?  The AI
              can help you articulate your symptoms clearly and
              concisely, translating your notes into language that
              providers understand.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <h3>Explain Medications</h3>
            <p>
              Enter the names and dosages of your medications and the AI
              will summarise what they do, potential side effects and
              common interactions.  This can prepare you to ask informed
              questions about your regimen.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <h3>Clarify Terms</h3>
            <p>
              When unfamiliar medical terms or diagnoses come up during
              appointments, use the AI to generate plain‑language
              explanations and find reputable resources for further
              reading.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <h3>Generate Follow‑Up Emails</h3>
            <p>
              After your visit, the AI can draft a follow‑up email
              summarising what was discussed and any next steps.  Edit it
              as needed before sending it to your provider to ensure
              clear communication.

        <h2>Future Capabilities</h2>
        <p>
          We plan to add new features such as summarising appointment
          recordings, tracking trends in your notes and integrating with
          patient portals.  Your feedback will help shape how these
          tools evolve.
