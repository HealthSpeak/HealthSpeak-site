          Empowering patients to SPEAK up and reclaim their voice in
          healthcare
        </p>
        <p>
          HealthSpeak is a patient‑first digital platform designed for
          people living with chronic, rare and invisible illnesses.  Born
          from lived experience and years of misdiagnosis, it provides a
          safe, empowering space to prepare for appointments, make informed
          decisions and reclaim your voice in healthcare.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our visual identity of orange ribbons and butterflies reflects
          hope, transformation and visibility – a reminder that you are not
          alone and your story matters.

      <!-- About Section -->
      <section id="about">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          HealthSpeak was created by a patient who understands the
          frustration of being dismissed and misdiagnosed.  After years of
          confusion and an eventual multiple sclerosis diagnosis, our
          founder decided to build the tool she wished existed: a place
          where patients can gather their history, track symptoms, capture
          questions and advocate for themselves with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>
          By combining compassionate design with firm advocacy, HealthSpeak
          helps you document what matters most to you and ensures your
          voice is heard.  We believe that every person deserves clear
          information and respectful care.
        </p>

      <!-- Mission Section -->
      <section id="mission">
        <h2>Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our mission is to empower patients to SPEAK up: share their
          history, clarify expectations, articulate real‑time concerns and
          plan for ongoing management.  We want to demystify medical
          jargon, make resources accessible and provide tools that support
          you before, during and after appointments.  In the short term
          we’re launching and refining our website, integrating AI tools
          and spreading awareness through our community channels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Long term, we envision HealthSpeak becoming a universal
          preparation and follow‑up app for patients, caregivers and
          providers.  By partnering with advocacy organisations and
          anonymising data to inform policy, we aim to build a network of
          patients who feel seen, prepared and heard – perhaps for the
          first time.
