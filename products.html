        <h2>Product Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
          Below are categories of products that other patients have found
          helpful.  These items can aid comfort, organisation and mental
          well‑being.  You can find them at pharmacies, online
          retailers or through local support organisations.  We do not
          endorse any specific brand.

            <h3>Sleep & Rest</h3>
            <p>
              Quality rest is vital.  Consider weighted blankets for
              calming pressure, ergonomic pillows to support neck and
              spine alignment, blackout curtains to block light and eye
              masks for deeper sleep.  Heating pads and cooling packs can
              also provide relief.
            </p>

          <li class="card">
            <h3>Mobility & Comfort</h3>
            <p>
              Mobility aids can reduce fatigue and pain.  Portable seat
              cushions, adjustable walking sticks, compression gloves or
              socks and adaptive utensils may improve daily activities.
              Consult a physical or occupational therapist for
              personalised advice.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li class="card">
            <h3>Organisation & Tracking</h3>
            <p>
              Keeping records is easier with tools like pill organisers,
              symptom journals, digital planners or apps that track
              medications, mood and activity levels.  The HealthSpeak
              Speak Form can also serve as your appointment log.
            </p>

          <li class="card">
            <h3>Mindfulness & Relaxation</h3>
            <p>
              Stress can exacerbate symptoms.  Try guided meditation
              apps, gentle yoga videos, noise‑cancelling headphones or
              calming teas.  Creative outlets like colouring books or
              knitting can also help reduce anxiety.
